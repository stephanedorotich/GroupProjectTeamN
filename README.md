# TeamN

## Who We Are
TeamN is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to our project's development.

## Stage One
For stage one we:
- Created an online [repository](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN)
- Created an online [portfolio](https://teamlepinee.wixsite.com/cpsc481teamn)
- Drafted a [team contract](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/teamContract_teamN.pdf)
- Submitted a [PDF](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/projectProposal_teamN.pdf) with three proposals for the team project.
